# Hyper Cloud Automation Docs

- For new cloud deployment our product is intended to simplify the deployment of foundation cloud architecture.
- For existing cloud service providers our product reduces the tedium of having to configure and deploy multiple Terreform packages and manually reconfiguring them.
- For cloud solution product deployments, such as DataBricks, our product provided minimal knowledge of initial deployment details. As close to single click fully integrated solution landscape as possible.
- It is cloud agnostic in that it allows deployment across all major cloud service providers.
- No need to have an expert Terraform knowledge to deploy infrastructure
- Infrastructure is displayed as a tree of dependencies. Dependencies between modules are easy to understand visually.
- Easy to create or modify environments and architectures
- Easy to deploy premade architectures by only modifying few global inputs
- Deployment jobs are tracked for easy auditing
